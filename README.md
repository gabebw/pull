I use `gh pull-request`, from [gh](https://github.com/jingweno/gh). You can also use `hub pull-request`, from [hub](https://github.com/github/hub).

## Pull

Creates Github pull requests from the command line.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'pull'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pull

## Usage

The gem assumes that you have a Github remote named "origin".

    # This breaks if your branch isn't on Github.
    $ git push origin your-branch
    $ pull
    Making a pull request for your-branch!

    https://github.com/USER/REPO/pull/1

Voila.

Thanks to Nick Quaranto ([qrush](https://github.com/qrush)) for writing the

touched.
